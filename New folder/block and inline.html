<h1>block level elements</h1>
<p> A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: p and div.

The p element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The div element defines a division or a section in an HTML document</p>
<h1>Inline Elements</h1>
<p>An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

examples are morque,bold tags</p>
